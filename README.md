Chosen Insight: 
Management Discussion and Analysis and  Risk Factors

I chose this, as the MD&A section provides a detailed overview of the company’s business operations, including key growth drivers, forward-looking statements. This can help you understand the company’s business model and strategies as well as show you their financials. The Risk Factor part tells you how the risk management stratergies, by the combination of these 2, I belive we could get great insight on how the company would do in the future, looking at its past trends and how the management reacts to risk.

The techstack I used: 
pandas - industry standard for data merging and cleaning
matplotlib - standard graphing library
beautiful soup 4 - useful for webscraping 
flutter - very easy to pick up for web development 
html + css - basic 

Gemini 1.5 pro - LLM of choice for inference
